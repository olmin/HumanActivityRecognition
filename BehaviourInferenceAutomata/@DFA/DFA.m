% [Description]
% Here defines the data structure of DFA
% This class deinfes the DFA structure
% properties
%    
%        FiniteSetOfStates is the set of finite states donated as Q
%        Alphabets is the set of alphabets
%        TransitionMatrix is the state transition matrix. 'X' is denoted as no transition
%        InitialState is the set of initial states
%        FinalAcceptStates is the set of final accepting states
%        FinalRejectStates is the rejecting states
%        
% Optional propoerties, needed in case of implmenting RPNI version
% of Colin de la Higuera, http://labh-curien.univ-st-etienne.fr/~cdlh/book/
%        
% RED is set of all the red states
% BLUE is set of all the blue states

function dfa = DFA(q, a, tm, i, fa, fr, red, blue)
            obj.FiniteSetOfStates = q;
            obj.Alphabets = a;
